<h2> Fact Establishing Co. </h2>

In a world full of abudance, money, politics, economic strife, 
success, and suffering run rampant. confusion, illeteracy, and 
basically every type of evil cruelity persist. how do we answer 
intelligently ? How do we do we take a meaningful position on
the most modern of times and issues in the social sciences and aboroad.

F.I. Press is intentionally a refuge for people who have experienced
pain, hurt, suffering, and trauma. We aim to offer an alternative 
source of philosphy for people who want to avoid the traditional literature.

<h2> CONTRACTUAL ANARACHY </h2>

As a company, city and culture, we have the rght to take on the toughest opinions anad 
the most controversial topics in the world of the free press. 
We have the right to question your assumptions your 
fervent irrationality and your unconcious humanity. 

<h3>  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT. </h3>

As publishers, 
We are committed to the highest standards of intellectual excellence
the most honest and deliberately rigorous investigations. and 
we are completely intentional in our examination of opinions
 and absolute minimalist use of 
research, studies, and statistics, phony or 
legitmate to further our arguments, for we hold deductive
 reasoning to be the judge of our discoursive method. 


<h3> POLITICS OF NOW. </h3>

As editors, 
It is our goal to express opinions that we believe in,
 and suppress ideas that we do not. we publish fully formed arguments 
 that will stand the test of time.
  we are producers of literary thought and of 
  expiltily practical ideas, implications and suggestions.
  with politically relevant conclusions. 


<h4>  ON CHESS AND GO. Disclaimer  </h4>

we are not interested in intellectual masturbation. Nor do we
emphatically endorse any one parties politics.
