 <p>our history, why we started and our plans for the future. 

 Falklands Islands Press was founded my Shujaa Tongrit-Green 
 and his best friend Anthony Dow. Anthony Dow was was a great friend, 
 artist, and educator from st. pauls's frogtown neighborhood.
 He worked as a refere, playright, and community orginizer and briefly 
 ran the orginization umoja, a family establishment that remains a relic
 in the minds of many and although anthony has passed, his memory and 
 legacy lives on in our heart mid and body. 

although anthony and shujaa talked for years about potentially 
creating a publishing house together, and anthony was not able to 
carry this mission out physically, shujaa, a frustrated low wage worker
at the time decided to pulll through in this effort to educate the 
the gifted, guide the curious, and humbling the goliaths
 by influenceing their oppenents.  </p>

<h3> GOALS AND AMBITIONS </h3>
